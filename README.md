# Code For Justice

C14 Code For Justice Group 4

## Project Overview

Our Team decided to make a website for a Non-Profit Organization that Focuses on the developing Fundamental Skill Set for Marginalized Students and Communities. The reason we chose this topic for our project was because wanted to raise awareness about the young students who currently struggle with fundamental skils such as basic reading and mathematics early on in their academic lives. We wanted to create a platform where parents who lack resources to help their children could still have an opportinity to help their children through our organization. With this in mind we decided to make our website using soft colors & fonts to better appeal to parents and students who visit the website.
