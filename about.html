<h1>About Us</h1>

   <div class="paragraphs">

      <p>Founded by CEO Benji Bennett and COO Hassan Niang, our non-profit organization was born from humble beginnings with a shared vision to make a difference in the lives of minority groups. It all started when Benji and Hassan recognized the profound impact that providing a platform for foundational skills could have within minority school systems. Their passion for equity in education drove them to create this organization. Over time, we've forged strategic partnerships with dedicated individuals like Victor, Tecambra, and Felicia, who share our commitment to addressing the pressing issue of foundational skills in minority communities. Together, we've been able to make a significant impact, not only locally but also on a global scale. Our journey is a testament to the power of collaboration and the unwavering belief in the transformative potential of education for all.</p>
      <br>
      <P>Since the founding of Building Blocks in 2012, we have partnered with elementary schools to help children improve their reading and mathematical skills. As of today, we have been able to expand to our middle and high schoolers. Our goal is to make sure every student has the opportunity to learn the fundamentals and grow in a nurturing environment. Having been able to incorporate tutoring and mentorship we have seen a meanigful impact that is long lasting. At our core, we are dedicated to empowering students with the essential tools for their educational journey. From laptops and tablets to a wide range of necessary equipment, we ensure that no student is left without the resources they need to thrive. Moreover, we go beyond mere provision by connecting our students with invaluable insights from community leaders, equipping them not only for academic success but also for a bright future when they graduate from our program. It's our commitment to fostering well-rounded individuals prepared for life's challenges and opportunities.
    </P>
